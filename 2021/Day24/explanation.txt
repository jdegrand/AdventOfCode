These equations need to be satisfied to cause a z = 0 at the end:

(inp3 - 8) = inp4
(inp7 + 5) = inp8
(inp6 - 7) = inp9
(inp10 - 6) = inp11
(inp5 + 6) = inp12
(inp2 - 1) = inp13
(inp1 + 1) = inp14


Using those rules, the following largest and smallest numbers can be formed:

Largest:
89913949293989

Smallest:
12911816171712
